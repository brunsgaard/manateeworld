                <p class="lead">Mating and Reproduction</p>
                <p>Similar to many large mammals, manatees have low production rates. They usually breed every two years. The gestation period for manatees is 12 month, and then the calf or the offspring lives another 12-18 month with the parent where the mother nurse the calf during that time.</p>

                <p class="lead">Diet</p>
                <p>Manatees are primarily herbivores. They feed on a wide variety of submerged, emergent, floating, and shoreline vegetation.</p>

                <p class="lead">Behaviour</p>
                <p>Getting food:     You will notice that the manatee features what looks like an elephant’s trunk but much smaller in size. This is what they use to gather their food as well as to consume it. They will spend a great deal of their time eating when they are awake.     The manatee prefers to consume food that is very close to the surface. The most they will dive is up to 33 feet. This is because it takes so much of their energy to go up and then back down into the water. They will migrate further from their natural habitat to find food when they need to instead of staying in that same area but diving deeper.      Protecting from predators:     The manatee is portrayed as a very slow moving mammal. It is true that their average speed is about 5 miles per hour. However, they can swim up to 15 miles per hour when they have to for a short period of time. They are very comfortable in the water though and have few predators so they don’t have to move very fast most of the time. Sleeping habits:     The manatee spends approximately half of each day sleeping in the water. They are able to go to the surface about three times an hour for air even during their resting period.</p>

                <p class="lead">Anatomy</p>
                <p>An adult manatee weighs around 450-500 kg and their height measures up to 4. Meters.  They breath through their nostrils and they can exchange about 90% of the air in their long in a single breath. Manatees can live up to 60 years or more.  They have relatively dense and heavy skeleton.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Christopher Columbus and other early explorers claimed to have seen female figures swimming in the ocean—the mermaids in the writings and drawings of this era. Whether they had been at sea for too long or it was a trick of the light, we now know that many of these encounters were with manatees.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Manatee brains are smooth (compared to our own that have the familiar ins and outs of cortical folds) and the ratio of their brain to their body size is the lowest of any mammal. They may not be as clever as dolphins, but manatees can learn basic tasks, are extremely sensitive to touch and can differentiate colors.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>If you are a mammal—whether that’s a human, giraffe, whale or rat—then you typically have seven neck vertebrae. Only tree sloths and manatees have an irregular number of vertebrae—just six for the manatee. Scientists think this may have to do with their slow metabolism.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
